## Notes

Nine of 25 patients (36%) in the NIVO cohort and 21 of 42 patients (50%) in the NIVO 1 IPI cohort required concomitant immunosuppressant use because of an immune-related adverse event.

There was one treatment-related death in each cohort: pneumonitis in the NIVO cohort and GI motility disorder because of enteric neuropathy in the NIVO 1 IPI cohort, the latter of which has been reported elsewhere.

Among patients who discontinued treatment for any reason other than disease progression, one of 18 patients (5.5%)
in the NIVO cohort and two of 28 patients (7.1%) in the NIVO 1 IPI cohort subsequently experienced disease pro-
gression.
