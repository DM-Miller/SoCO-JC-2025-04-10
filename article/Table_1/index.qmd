## Notes

The NIVO monotherapy cohort had a numerically lower proportion of patients with adverse prognostic factors than the combination treatment cohort, including age ≥65 years (60% v 74%, respectively), an ECOG PS of 1 (40% v 63%), stage IV disease (80% v 93%), virus-negative MCC (28% v 42%), and tumor burden at baseline (median, 55.5 v 72 mm; Table 1).
